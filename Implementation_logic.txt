1. Data extraction and feed parsing

Script (parser.py): Uses the feedparser library to read a list of supplied RSS feeds.

parses every feed and pulls pertinent data, such as the title, content, publication date, and source URL, from every news story.
uses the title and publication date to create a unique hash identifier (hash_id) in order to handle duplicate items from the same feed.

2. Models.py - Database Storage Schema

builds a SQLAlchemy model (NewsArticle) that reflects the PostgreSQL database's news_articles table's structure.
uses hash_id as the primary key in order to guarantee uniqueness.
keeps track of details including the category, source URL, title, and text as well as the publication date.
Parser.py and tasks.py logic:

makes use of SQLAlchemy to communicate with databases.

checks the database to see if there are any duplicate articles before storing new ones.

3. News processing and task queue configuration (tasks.py):

Sets up Celery to handle news article asynchronous processing.
creates a task queue to manage the tasks that need to be processed.
uses Celery employees to take items out of the queue and carry out additional processing.
Processing News (tasks.py):

gives each article a categorization using an NLTK-trained NLP classifier.
adds the appropriate category for every article to the database.

4. Error Handling and Logging (tasks.py, app.py):

enables logging to be used across the application to monitor events and any problems.
records data in two distinct log files (tasks.log and app.log) to improve traceability.

Error Management (tasks.py, app.py):

gracefully resolves network connectivity problems and parser mistakes during RSS feed retrieval.

logs errors to give information about possible problems that may arise during execution.
Design Decisions


1. The Flask of Technology Stack:

Because of its ease of use and adaptability, it was chosen as the web framework for creating RESTful APIs.
Ideal for more compact apps such as this news aggregator.
Celery

chosen due to its capacity for handling asynchronous operations, which is essential for processing news articles in the background effectively.
SQL Alchemy:

used to communicate with databases and offer an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) method for using PostgreSQL. NLTK:

used for content-based news article classification using natural language processing.

2. Database Design Table Structure (models.py): Made to hold the fundamental data related to every news item.
Uses a hash identifier (hash_id) as the primary key to ensure uniqueness and simplify data retrieval.

3. Asynchronous Processing Accelerator for Task Queue: This feature increases scalability and
 responsiveness by allowing the application to handle jobs asynchronously.

4. NLP, or natural language processing
Text Classification with NLTK:
Selected due to its ease of use and integration.
teaches a Naive Bayes classifier to classify news items into pre-established groups.

In summary, the news aggregator software presents a practical method for gathering, 
organising, and classifying news items from many RSS sources. By using appropriate logging and 
error handling, the selected technology and design decisions seek to address potential problems and 
offer a scalable and maintainable solution. NLP adds another level of intelligence to the process 
of classifying articles according to their content.

Future Improvements:

Put user authentication into practice for customised news streams.
To increase accuracy, increase the size of the NLP classifier's training dataset.
Include a front-end interface so that users may interact and see news stories.
Improve error handling so that users can receive more thorough feedback.
